# PRISM - Pattern Recognition & Interactive Sketch Machine

## Overview
PRISM is an AI-driven creative system that generates sophisticated geometric animations using Processing. It functions as an automated art studio with evolutionary memory, treating each creation as a data point in a living system. The system emphasizes continuous evolution through pattern analysis, technique synergy tracking, and historical learning.
