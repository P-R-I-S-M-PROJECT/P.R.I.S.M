# PRISM Technical Overview

## Core Architecture

PRISM is an automated art studio agent powered by a multi-model AI architecture. It leverages OpenAI and Anthropic models for creative code-based art generation, alongside FAL's Flux model for static visual art. The system functions as an evolving creative entity, learning from its artistic journey and adapting its approach based on experience.
