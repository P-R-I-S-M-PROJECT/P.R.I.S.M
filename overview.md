# PRISM Technical Overview

## Core Architecture

PRISM is an automated art studio agent powered by a multi-model AI architecture. It leverages OpenAI and Anthropic models for creative code-based art generation, alongside FAL's Flux model for static visual art. The system functions as an evolving creative entity, learning from its artistic journey and adapting its approach based on experience.

## Interactive Studio Interface

The system provides an intuitive studio interface:

1. **Art Creation**
   - Single piece creation with immediate feedback
   - Multi-piece creative sessions
   - Continuous studio operation
   - Model selection for different artistic approaches
   - Static artwork creation with Flux AI

2. **Creative Models**
   - Adaptive model selection
   - Direct model choice for focused work
   - Seamless creative flow
   - Performance tracking per model

3. **Studio Management**
   - Artwork organization and archival
   - Debug mode for process insight
   - Model experimentation suite
   - Creative metrics and analytics

## AI Models

The studio integrates multiple AI models, each bringing unique creative capabilities:

1. **OpenAI Models**
   - O1: Balanced creation
   - O1-mini: Rapid iteration
   - 4O: Advanced generation

2. **Anthropic Models**
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Nuanced creation
   - Claude 3 Opus: Complex artworks

3. **FAL Models**
   - Flux.1 [dev] for static visual art

Each model contributes equally to the creative process with 16.67% representation in random selection mode.
